abstract = {Purpose Introduce Shimming Toolbox ( https://shimming-toolbox.org), an open-source software package for prototyping new methods and performing static, dynamic, and real-time B0 shimming as well as B1 shimming experiments. Methods Shimming Toolbox features various field mapping techniques, manual and automatic masking for the brain and spinal cord, B0 and B1 shimming capabilities accessible through a user-friendly graphical user interface. Validation of Shimming Toolbox was demonstrated in three scenarios: (i) B0 dynamic shimming in the brain at 7T using custom AC/DC coils, (ii) B0 real-time shimming in the spinal cord at 3T, and (iii) B1 static shimming in the spinal cord at 7T. Results The B0 dynamic shimming of the brain at 7T took about 10 min to perform. It showed a 47\% reduction in the standard deviation of the B0 field, associated with noticeable improvements in geometric distortions in EPI images. Real-time dynamic xyz-shimming in the spinal cord took about 5 min and showed a 30\% reduction in the standard deviation of the signal distribution. B1 static shimming experiments in the spinal cord took about 10 min to perform and showed a 40\% reduction in the coefficient of variation of the B1 field. Conclusion Shimming Toolbox provides an open-source platform where researchers can collaborate, prototype and conveniently test B0 and B1 shimming experiments. Future versions will include additional field map preprocessing techniques, optimization algorithms, and compatibility across multiple MRI manufacturers.},

  abstract = "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disorder of the CNS
              that affects both the brain and the spinal cord. MRI studies in
              MS focus more often on the brain than on the spinal cord, owing
              to the technical challenges in imaging this smaller, mobile
              structure. However, spinal cord abnormalities at disease onset
              have important implications for diagnosis and prognosis.
              Furthermore, later in the disease course, in progressive MS,
              myelopathy becomes the primary characteristic of the clinical
              presentation, and extensive spinal cord pathology--including
              atrophy, diffuse abnormalities and numerous focal lesions--is
              common. Recent spinal cord imaging studies have employed
              increasingly sophisticated techniques to improve detection and
              quantification of spinal cord lesions, and to elucidate their
              relationship with physical disability. Quantitative MRI measures
              of cord size and tissue integrity could be more sensitive to the
              axonal loss and other pathological processes in the spinal cord
              than is conventional MRI, putting quantitative MRI in a key role
              to elucidate the association between disability and spinal cord
              abnormalities seen in people with MS. In this Review, we
              summarize the most recent MS spinal cord imaging studies and
              discuss the new insights they have provided into the mechanisms
              of neurological impairment. Finally, we suggest directions for
              further and future research.",

              matter resulting from injury can be observed with MRI techniques.
              These techniques provide sensitive markers of macrostructural and
              microstructural tissue integrity, which correlate with
              histological findings. Spinal cord MRI findings in traumatic
              spinal cord injury (tSCI) and nontraumatic spinal cord injury -
              the most common form of which is degenerative cervical myelopathy
              (DCM) - have provided important insights into the
              pathophysiological processes taking place not just at the focal
              injury site but also rostral and caudal to the spinal injury.
              Although tSCI and DCM have different aetiologies, they show
              similar degrees of spinal cord pathology remote from the injury
              site, suggesting the involvement of similar secondary
              degenerative mechanisms. Advanced quantitative MRI protocols that
              are sensitive to spinal cord pathology have the potential to
              improve diagnosis and, more importantly, predict outcomes in
              patients with tSCI or nontraumatic spinal cord injury. This

  abstract = "PURPOSE: To aid in discussion about the mechanism for central
              brightening in high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
              especially regarding the appropriateness of using the term
              dielectric resonance to describe the central brightening seen in
              images of the human head. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present both
              numerical calculations and experimental images at 3 T of a
              35-cm-diameter spherical phantom of varying salinity both with
              one surface coil and with two surface coils on opposite sides,
              and further numerical calculations at frequencies corresponding
              to dielectric resonances for the sphere. RESULTS: With two
              strategically placed surface coils it is possible to create
              central brightening even when one coil alone excites an image
              intensity pattern either bright on one side only or bright on
              both sides with central darkening. This central brightening can
              be created with strategic coil placement even when the resonant
              pattern would favor central darkening. Results in a conductive
              sample show that central brightening can similarly be achieved in
              weakly conductive dielectric materials where any true resonances
              would be heavily damped, such as in human tissues. CONCLUSION:
              Constructive interference and wavelength effects are likely
              bigger contributors to central brightening in MR images of weakly
              conductive biological samples than is true dielectric resonance.",

  title    = "Radiofrequency penetration and absorption in the human body:
              limitations to high-field whole-body nuclear magnetic resonance

  abstract = "This study presents experimental results about the effective
              depth of penetration and about the radiofrequency (rf) power
              absorption in humans as a function of frequency. The frequency
              range investigated covers 10 up to 220 MHz. For the main part,
              the results were derived from bench measurements of the quality
              factor Q, and of the resonance frequency shift due to the loading
              of the coil. Different types of head-, body-, and surface coils
              were investigated loaded with volunteers or metallic phantoms.
              For spin-echo imaging at 2 T (85 MHz), the local specific
              absorption rate (SAR) was found to be approximately equal to 0.05
              W/kg using a pi pulse of 1-ms duration and pulse repetition time
              TR = 1 s. Measurements of the quality factor Q as a function of
              frequency show that the SAR depends upon the frequency f
              according to approximately f2.15. The effective depth of rf
              penetration as derived drops from 17 cm at 85 MHz to 7 cm at 220
              MHz. Head imaging with B1 penetrating from practically all sides
              into the object should be possible up to 220 MHz (5 T) with SAR
              values staying within the local limit of 2 W/kg as set by the
              FDA. Whole-body imaging of large subjects as well as surface coil
              imaging is depth limited above 100-MHz frequency. Perturbation
              methods are applied in order to separate the total rf power
              deposition in the patient into dielectric and magnetic
              contributions. The observed effects due to interactions of rf
              magnetic fields with biological tissue contradict predictions
              based on homogeneous tissue models. A refined tissue model with
              regions of high electrical conductivity, subdivided by
              quasi-insulating adipose layers, provides a rationale for a
              better understanding of the underlying processes. At frequencies
              below 100 MHz, the rf power deposition in patients is apparently
              more evenly distributed over the exposed body volume than
              currently assumed.",

              occurring in a pure water phantom near 300 MHz is greatly
              dampened in the human head due to the strong decay of the

abstract = {Template-based analysis of multi-parametric MRI data of the spinal cord sets the foundation for standardization and reproducibility, thereby helping the discovery of new biomarkers of spinal-related diseases. While MRI templates of the spinal cord have been recently introduced, none of them cover the entire spinal cord. In this study, we introduced an unbiased multimodal MRI template of the spinal cord and the brainstem, called PAM50, which is anatomically compatible with the ICBM152 brain template and uses the same coordinate system. The PAM50 template is based on 50 healthy subjects, covers the full spinal cord (C1 to L2 vertebral levels) and the brainstem, is available for T1-, T2-and T2*-weighted MRI contrasts and includes a probabilistic atlas of the gray matter and white matter tracts. Template creation accuracy was assessed by computing the mean and maximum distance error between each individual spinal cord centerline and the PAM50 centerline, after registration to the template. Results showed high accuracy for both T1- (mean = 0.37 ± 0.06 mm; max = 1.39 ± 0.58 mm) and T2-weighted (mean = 0.11 ± 0.03 mm; max = 0.71 ± 0.27 mm) contrasts. Additionally, the preservation of the spinal cord topology during the template creation process was verified by comparing the cross-sectional area (CSA) profile, averaged over all subjects, and the CSA profile of the PAM50 template. The fusion of the PAM50 and ICBM152 templates will facilitate group and multi-center studies of combined brain and spinal cord MRI, and enable the use of existing atlases of the brainstem compatible with the ICBM space.}
